- Solve bug abuse on score (not jumping). // Done I think, but could be more elegant.
- Fix message telling to press space (it should stay until space has been pressed). // Done 
	but there is an issue,	too many timers are created. // Obsolete
- Change platform sprites. Use animations. // Semi-done.
- Make high score. // Done but not tested with export! It works (for Windows)!
- Background. // Done but ugly.
- Add instructions to the game (a menu telling what to do). // Done.
- Add animation for when a platform exits the screen (see RandomIdeas.md). // Done but ugly.
- Change color of score label on scored. // Done.
- Pause button. // Done.
- Make platform edges better (no weird bounces). // Done I think.
- Make platforms thicker. // Done.
- Export on Linux. // Done.
- Change the way the character "bounces" on walls and roof. // Done.
- Make text proportionnal to the window size. // Done I think, not sure about the result, 
												// needs testing. It's not great, it doesn't work correctly.

- Export on Android. 
- Sound?
- Clean code (prints and useless crap). // Maybe.
- Finish comments and documentation.
- Balance.
- Rework the platform animation.
- Rework difficulty scaling?
- Custom buttons.
- Make first platforms closer to the ground so there is no waiting. 
	Waiting could remain as a choice for beginners.
- Fix window resize behavior. // Should be hard.
- Make it so the player can end the game from a menu.
