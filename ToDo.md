- Solve bug abuse on score (not jumping). // Done I think, but could be more elegant.
- Fix message telling to press space (it should stay until space has been pressed). // Done 
	but there is an issue,	too many timers are created. // Obsolete
- Change platform sprites. Use animations.
- Export on Linux/Android.
- Make high score. // Done but not tested with export!
- Sound?
- Background.
- Clean code (prints and useless crap). // Maybe.
- Finish comments and documentation.
- Balance.
- Add instructions to the game (a menu telling what to do). // Done.
- Add animation for when a platform exits the screen (see RandomIdeas.md). // Done but ugly.
- Rework difficulty scaling?
