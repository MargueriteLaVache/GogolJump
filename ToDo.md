- Solve bug abuse on score (not jumping). // Done I think, but could be more elegant.
- Fix message telling to press space (it should stay until space has been pressed). // Done but there is an issue,
	too many timers are created.
- Change platform sprites. Use animations.
- Make high score. // Done but not tested with export!
- Sound?
- Background.
- Clean code (prints and useless crap).
- Finish comments and documentation.
- Balance.
- Add instructions to the game (a menu telling what to do).
- Add animation for when a platform exits the screen. (see RandomIdeas.md)
