In this game, 
you control a round character that jumps automatically.

You can use the left and right arrow keys to move 
the character. This might prove trickier than it looks,
because of how the inertia of the character works.

Moving platforms appear at the top of the screen,
and travel top to bottom to disappear at the bottom.

Once you start jumping on platforms, the ground disappears;
beware, for falling means game over!

The goal is to earn score points, which are obtained 
when a platform reaches the bottom of the screeen,
while avoiding falling.

You cannot exit the screen by the top nor the sides,
you bounce on them.

Note: you can press Enter instead of clicking 
on the Start Game Button, as well as P for the Pause!

This is it for the instructions, now good luck and have fun!"
