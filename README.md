# Gogol Jump
This project is a small 2D game in which you control a round character,
in the shape of a multi-colored "**G**", that jumps around on moving platforms, trying to
avoid falling down. Points are obtained over time (when paltforms reach the bottom of the screen),
the goal being to reach the highest score possible.




The current build uses Godot 4.1.1.stable.
