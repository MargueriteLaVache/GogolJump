- Solve bug abuse on score (not jumping). // Done I think, but could be more elegant.
- Fix message telling to press space (it should stay until space has been pressed). // Done 
	but there is an issue,	too many timers are created. // Obsolete
- Change platform sprites. Use animations. // Semi-done.
- Make high score. // Done but not tested with export! It works (for Windows)!
- Background. // Done but ugly.
- Add instructions to the game (a menu telling what to do). // Done.
- Add animation for when a platform exits the screen (see RandomIdeas.md). // Done but ugly.
- Change color of score label on scored. // Done.
- Pause button. // Done.
- Make platform edges better (no weird bounces). // Done I think.
- Make platforms thicker. // Done.
- Export on Linux. // Done.
- Change the way the character "bounces" on walls and roof. // Done.
- Make text proportionnal to the window size. // Done I think, not sure about the result, needs
											// testing. It's not great, it doesn't work correctly.
- Rework the platform animation. // Done.
- Make it so the player can end the game from a menu. // Done.
- Make first platforms closer to the ground so there is no waiting. // Done.
	Waiting could remain as a choice for beginners. // Done.
- Custom buttons. // Semi-done.
- Implement Notes.md. // Done.
- Reduce bounce on walls ? // Done.
- Change background theme to light. Make it as an option? // Done.
- Make shortcuts for buttons. // Done.
- Add intro animation. // Done.
- Add more background sprites. // Done.
- Make options stay in save. // Done.
- New highscore animation. // Done more or less.
- Make border of character and platforms black so it's more visible. Trying something with shader,
	it seems ok but it won't work on platforms as it is
	(I think, maybe I'll try. I don't like the result),
	to make it work I would have to change the way the platform end animation works 
	(separate the explosion animation from the other ones).
	This is either a by hand angle or a quit. // Done?
- Make story. // Done.
- Change ground sprite. // Done but not satisfying. 
						// This could be better with the grass on a different layer, idk really.
- Sound? // Done in principle, more sounds should be added for a better effect.
		// The game over sound should be done by mouth.
- Make options default to true. // Done.
- Make platforms abundant at the beginning and rarer at the end. // Done.
- Change explosion animation for one that fits correctly. // Done.
- Clean code (prints and useless crap). // Maybe. Make a copy of the project and clean the main repo.
										// Done.
- Fix explosion animation borders.
- Create theme resource (beuh...). // Done. Only partial cause I don't want to deal with this.
- Rework difficulty scaling? // Done.
- Balance. // Done.
- Finish comments and documentation. // Semi-done.
- Make in-game credits? // Done but not pretty.

- Export on Android. // Probably not gonna happen.
- Fix window resize behavior. // Should be hard.
- Make demo?
