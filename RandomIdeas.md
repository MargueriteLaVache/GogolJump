- Flip animation left and right. Obsolete.

- Boost upwards when player touches a platform (tp for starters (not)). Done.

- For the character sprite to go through the platforms from below, we could check 
	the relative vertical position of the two, and toggle the tangibility of the platform. Obsolete

- Instead of having the character portal through the other side when touching an edge, 
	we could have a wall blocking the way on both sides. Done.

- Animation when a platform exits the screen. There should be a way to show this is how the points are optained.
	This could be a mere spark on the spot the platform disappears from. This seems a bit complicated.
	This could be done with the animation part: Change the animation to a spark sprite. Done but ugly.

- The whole "press space to start jumping" stuff could be deleted as it serves no real purpose. TBD.
